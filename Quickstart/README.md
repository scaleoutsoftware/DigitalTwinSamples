# Quickstart Models

This repository contains finished sample code to accompany the ScaleOut Digital Twins [Quickstart Guide](https://static.scaleoutsoftware.com/docs/digital_twin_user_guide/quickstart/intro.html). For each language, it includes the model .zip file, which can be deployed directly to the ScaleOut Digital Twins UI. In the src/ folders, you can find an example project structure with completed code for the real-time model, message, and message processor. 

Note: To create a functioning app from the source files, additional configuration steps are required. Please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://static.scaleoutsoftware.com/docs/digital_twin_user_guide/quickstart/intro.html) for instructions on setting up your project according to your preferred programming language.
