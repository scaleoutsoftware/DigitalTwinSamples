# Sample for Machine Learning in .NET Core models

This sample has 3 folders:

* Sensors
* TrainingData
* TrainedAlgorithm


## Sensors

This folder contains the Visual Studio solution with the implementation of a simple Digital Twin model leveraging the Machine Learning capabilities. Please refer to the Walkthrough section of the ScaleOut documentation on the ScaleOut Machine Learning Training Tool. It includes unit tests showing how to use the Machine Learning extension of the Workbench to run and test the model locally.

## TrainingData

This is the data that was used to train a Machine Learning algorithm specific to the Sensors digital twin model provided in this Sample.

## TrainedAlgorithm

This is the ZIP file produced by the ScaleOut Machine Learning Training Tool specifically for the Sensors model and the associated Training Data provided in this sample.
